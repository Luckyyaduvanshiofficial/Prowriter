# 🎯 ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

## ❌ The Real Error

```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'extractText')
at getWordCount (lib\html-sanitizer.ts:144:22)
```

**Location:** Line 144 in `lib/html-sanitizer.ts`

```typescript
static getWordCount(html: string): number {
    const text = this.extractText(html)  // ❌ this.extractText is undefined!
    return text.split(/\s+/).filter(word => word.length > 0).length
}
```

## 🔍 Why It Failed

### The Problem with JavaScript `this` Context

When you export a class method like this:
```typescript
export const getWordCount = HTMLSanitizer.getWordCount
```

The `this` keyword inside `getWordCount` loses its reference to `HTMLSanitizer`. So when the code tries to call `this.extractText()`, `this` is `undefined`.

### The Error Chain

1. API route calls: `getWordCount(article)`
2. Inside `getWordCount`, it tries: `this.extractText(html)`
3. But `this` is undefined (no class context)
4. JavaScript throws: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'extractText')`

## ✅ The Solution

Changed from **direct method reference** to **arrow functions**:

### Before (BROKEN):
```typescript
export const getWordCount = HTMLSanitizer.getWordCount
```

### After (FIXED):
```typescript
export const getWordCount = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.getWordCount(html)
```

This ensures the method is always called with the correct class context.

## 📋 All Fixed Exports

```typescript
export const sanitizeHTML = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.sanitize(html)
export const extractText = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.extractText(html)
export const getWordCount = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.getWordCount(html)
export const getReadingTime = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.getReadingTime(html)
export const extractMetaDescription = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.extractMetaDescription(html)
export const extractTitle = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.extractTitle(html)
export const formatForDisplay = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.formatForDisplay(html)
export const isValidHTML = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.isValidHTML(html)
export const stripHTML = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.stripHTML(html)
export const toMarkdown = (html: string) => HTMLSanitizer.toMarkdown(html)
```

## 🎉 Result

Now when the API calls `getWordCount(article)`:
1. ✅ Arrow function receives the html parameter
2. ✅ Calls `HTMLSanitizer.getWordCount(html)` with proper class context
3. ✅ Inside the method, `this.extractText()` works correctly
4. ✅ Returns word count successfully

## 📚 Technical Explanation

This is a classic JavaScript problem with method references losing their `this` binding. When you assign a method to a variable:

```javascript
const fn = object.method  // ❌ Loses 'this' context
```

Later when you call `fn()`, the `this` inside the method is `undefined` (in strict mode) or the global object.

The solution is to use arrow functions or `.bind()`:

```javascript
const fn = (...args) => object.method(...args)  // ✅ Maintains context
// OR
const fn = object.method.bind(object)  // ✅ Maintains context
```

We used the arrow function approach because it's cleaner and more modern.

**Status: ✅ COMPLETELY FIXED**  
**File Modified:** `lib/html-sanitizer.ts`  
**Issue:** Lost `this` context in exported methods  
**Solution:** Use arrow functions to maintain class context
