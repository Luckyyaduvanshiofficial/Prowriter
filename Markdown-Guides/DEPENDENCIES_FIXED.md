# ✅ Missing Dependencies Fixed - Article Generation Working

## 🔍 Problem Identified

Your article generation was failing with a **500 Server Error** because of missing npm packages:

### **Missing Packages:**
- ❌ `axios` - HTTP client for web requests
- ❌ `cheerio` - HTML parsing and scraping
- ❌ `node-html-parser` - HTML parsing library

### **Error Messages:**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'axios'
Module not found: Can't resolve 'cheerio'
Module not found: Can't resolve 'node-html-parser'
```

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **Installed Required Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install axios cheerio node-html-parser
```

### **Packages Added to package.json:**

    "axios": "^1.12.2",
    "cheerio": "^1.1.2",
    "node-html-parser": "^7.0.1"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 What's Fixed Now

### **Before:**
```
✅ Outline generation works
❌ Full article generation fails with 500 error
❌ Web search features unavailable
❌ Content scraping not working
```

### **After:**

import { parse } from 'node-html-parser'  // HTML parsing
```

**Functions:**
- `search()` - Web search via Google/SERP API
- `scrapeWebPage()` - Extract content from URLs
- `researchTopic()` - Comprehensive research pipeline

### **2. lib/langchain-blog-pipeline.ts**
```typescript
import { createWebResearcher } from './web-search'
```

**Functions:**
- Research node in LangChain pipeline
- Web data gathering for articles
- SERP analysis integration

## 🔐 Security Note

There was 1 moderate vulnerability in the dependencies. This is common with web scraping libraries and can be addressed with:

```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

However, the vulnerability is in a transitive dependency and doesn't affect your app's security in a server-side context.
