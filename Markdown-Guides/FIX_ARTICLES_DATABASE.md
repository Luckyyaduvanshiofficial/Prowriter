# Fix for "Articles Not Saved in Database"

## Problem
Articles were not being saved to the database because:
1. The Articles collection was missing required attributes
2. The database ID was set to a placeholder value

## Solution

### Step 1: Update the Articles Collection Schema
Run this command to add all missing attributes to the Articles collection:

```bash
npm run update:articles-schema
```

This will add the following attributes if they don't exist:
- metaDescription
- modelA, modelB
- useCase, articleLength, aiEngine
- seoKeywords, targetAudience, brandVoice
- usedWebSearch, usedSerpAnalysis
- estimatedReadingTime, status

### Step 2: Verify Setup
Check that everything is configured correctly:

```bash
npm run verify:setup
```

### Step 3: Test Article Saving
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Generate an article
3. Check the console logs for "✅ Article saved successfully"
4. Verify in Appwrite Console that the article appears in the Articles collection

## If Articles Collection Doesn't Exist

If you haven't set up the database yet, run:

```bash
npm run setup:appwrite
```

This will create:
- The database (if it doesn't exist)
- Users collection with all required attributes
- Articles collection with all required attributes

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Database not configured properly"
- Check your `.env` file
- Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` is set to your actual database ID
- You can find this in Appwrite Console → Databases

### Error: "Collection not found"
- Run `npm run setup:appwrite` to create collections
- Or manually create the Articles collection in Appwrite Console

### Error: "Attribute missing"
- Run `npm run update:articles-schema` to add missing attributes

## What Changed

1. **setup-appwrite.js** - Updated to create all required article attributes
2. **save-article/route.ts** - Removed placeholder database check, now actually saves articles
3. **update-articles-schema.js** - New script to update existing collections
4. **Better error messages** - More helpful error messages when saving fails

## Verification

After running the update, you should see:
- ✅ Articles saved to database
- ✅ Console log: "Article saved successfully"
- ✅ Articles visible in Appwrite Console
- ✅ Articles appear in your articles list
