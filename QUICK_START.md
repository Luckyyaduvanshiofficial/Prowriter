# 🚀 Prowriter AI - Quick Start with Appwrite

## ✅ What's Done

✓ Removed all database-related files (Neon, Supabase, Prisma)  
✓ Cleaned up package.json (removed 50+ unnecessary dependencies)  
✓ Added Appwrite SDK (client & server)  
✓ Created Appwrite configuration (`lib/appwrite.ts`)  
✓ Created authentication module (`lib/auth.ts`)  
✓ Updated auth context (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)  
✓ Fixed dependency conflicts (date-fns version)  

## 📦 Current Package Size

**Before:** ~80 dependencies  
**After:** ~25 essential dependencies

4. Create an API Key with full permissions
5. Create database `prowriter_db`
6. Create collections: `users` and `articles`
7. Update `.env.local` with your credentials

### 3. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your values
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
