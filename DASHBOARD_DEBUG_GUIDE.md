# Dashboard Sign-In Debugging Guide

## What I Fixed

### 1. Added Debug Logging Throughout Auth Flow
- ✅ `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Shows when user is fetched and loaded
- ✅ `lib/auth.ts` - Shows getCurrentUser() calls and results  
- ✅ `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Shows dashboard auth state checks
- ✅ `app/sign-in/page.tsx` - Shows sign-in success

### 2. Improved Dashboard Loading Logic
- Added 500ms delay before redirecting to sign-in
- Won't redirect while auth is still loading
- Better handling of undefined states

### 3. Added Small Delay After Sign-In
- 100ms delay ensures session cookie is set before redirect

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
Press `F12` to open DevTools and go to the Console tab

### Step 2: Clear Everything
1. Clear browser cache and cookies (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Close all browser tabs
3. Restart the dev server if needed

### Step 3: Try to Sign In

Visit `http://localhost:3000/sign-in` and watch the console. You should see:

```
✅ Sign in successful, redirecting to dashboard...
(redirect happens)
🔍 Fetching current user...
🔍 getCurrentUser: Calling account.get()...
```

**If successful:**
```
✅ getCurrentUser: Success! { id: '...', email: 'test@prowriter.ai' }
✅ User fetched: test@prowriter.ai (67...)
🏁 Auth loaded, isLoaded=true
📊 Dashboard useEffect: { isLoaded: true, isSignedIn: true, hasUser: true }
✅ User signed in, loading data
Loading user data for: 67...
```

**If failing (401 error):**
```
❌ getCurrentUser: Failed { code: 401, message: '...' }
⚠️ Error fetching user: 401 ...
🏁 Auth loaded, isLoaded=true
📊 Dashboard useEffect: { isLoaded: true, isSignedIn: false, hasUser: false }
❌ Not signed in, redirecting to sign-in
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Getting 401 After Sign-In
**Cause:** Session cookie not being set or read properly

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for "Sign in successful" message
2. Go to DevTools > Application > Cookies
3. Look for Appwrite session cookies (they start with `a_session_`)
4. If no cookies, the session isn't being created

**Fix:**
- Make sure `.env` has correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`
- Try signing in again with correct credentials
- Check if dev server is running on correct port

### Issue 2: Redirect Loop
**Cause:** Dashboard redirects to sign-in, sign-in redirects to dashboard

**Solution:**
- This is fixed with the 500ms delay
- If still happening, check console for the auth state logs

### Issue 3: "SyntaxError: [object Object] is not valid JSON"
**Cause:** Browser extension trying to parse something

**Solution:**
- This is NOT your app's error - it's from a browser extension
- Ignore it or disable extensions to confirm

### Issue 4: 401 on Every Page Load
**Cause:** This is expected when NOT logged in

**Solution:**
- The auth context now silently handles 401 errors
- You should only see the ⚠️ log, not an error

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Sign in with `test@prowriter.ai` / `TestPassword123`
2. ✅ Check console shows "Sign in successful"
3. ✅ Check console shows "User fetched: test@prowriter.ai"
4. ✅ Check console shows "Dashboard useEffect: isSignedIn: true"
5. ✅ Dashboard should load and NOT redirect
6. ✅ You should see your email in the header

## If Dashboard Still Not Working

### Check Session Cookies
1. Open DevTools > Application > Cookies
2. Find cookies for `localhost:3000`
3. Look for cookies starting with `a_session_`
4. If present, session exists!

### Manual Session Test
1. After signing in successfully
2. Open browser console
3. Run this:
```javascript
fetch('/api/auth/me')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Current user:', data))
```

If it returns user data, session works!
If it returns 401, session is not persisting

## Next Steps

1. Try signing in and watch the console logs
2. Tell me which log messages you see
3. If you see "getCurrentUser: Failed", the session isn't working
4. If you see "getCurrentUser: Success" but still redirecting, there's a different issue
